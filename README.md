FFT is uesd to extract the features using pyeeg module
Introduction
Used deap dataset to extract features from eeg signals
Deap dataset contains observations of 32 participants watching 40 one 
Minute videos each
The feature extraction technique used is fft
Fast Fourier transform converts time domain signals into
Frequency domain signals
Extracted spectral power of 5 frequency bands and applied 
a covolutional model to classify and predict the emotions
